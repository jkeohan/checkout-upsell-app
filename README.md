## Shopify for eCommerce

Shopify is the second most used e-commerce platform worldwide, with 20% of the top 1 million live websites worldwide being powered by Shopify, following WooCommerce, which has the largest market share. It's particularly dominant in the United States, which is its biggest market with a 66.8% share1 and several large and well-known brands use Shopify. These include Nestle, Pepsi, Unilever, Kylie Cosmetics, Vogue, and Gymshark.


According to Shopify, more than 1.7 million businesses have made over $200 billion in sales with their Shopify websites. Furthermore, Shopify was recently named by Forbes Advisor as one of the best website builders and one of the best e-commerce platforms2.
